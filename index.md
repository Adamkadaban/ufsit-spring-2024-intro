## Challenge

This challenge involves learning a bit about DNS records. I have placed the [flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)#:~:text=Capture%20the%20Flag%20(CTF)%20in,both%20competitive%20or%20educational%20purposes.) in a DNS record on the [flag.adamkadaban.lol](http://flag.adamkadaban.lol) subdomain.

Try to figure out what kind of record would be useful for holding _text_ in it.

Once you get the solution, bring the flag to our first GBM (read more below) for free candy, pizza, and stickers!

### Tips

There are websites that will do this for you.

If you want to delve deeper, you can learn about the `dig` utility in linux. (Click [here](https://linux.die.net/man/1/dig) to see more)
